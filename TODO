* Build binaries from the sources, Upload them to a public server and give the url in the README, so that non-technical users can download and execute the program instead of compiling from the sources.
* Translate error messages and progress statements to Tamil.
* Create a generic-tamil-words-parser.go from the existing sources, by deleting the lines related to the XML parsing. This will help in extracting tamil words and stats from any documents.
* Add automated test cases to make sure the parser does not cause any regression in case of changes

All the above tasks are simple to do and will require only about a day maximum for each task. However, since my time is required elsewhere I am unable to do these now and will appreciate if someone can contribute.
